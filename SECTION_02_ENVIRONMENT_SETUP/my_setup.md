VS Code
- theme

- font sizes larger for recordings

Console formatting

Packages

Virtual Environment
- `python -m venv venv`
- `.\venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux)

treat each SECTION as its own project.
I find it best to:
- open that section as root in VS Code
- `python -m venv venv`
- `pip install requirements.txt`
