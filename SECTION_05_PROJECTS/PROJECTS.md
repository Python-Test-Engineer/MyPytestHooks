# Projects

## 01

### Objective: Learn about the pytest_collection_modifyitems hook as well as created a report of tests that *will* be run

- We learn how to make a basic report so that we can save results to file.
- This report is basic as we will later cover more detailed reports.
- We create a report of test names and all their keywords and output to file.

This is a real world example where a manager needed a list of tests we run. Based on the keywords of a test, we were able to create a variety of reports.

## 02

### Objective: Learn how to programatically add markers to tests

This will be useful later on when we want to sort, filter, randomise tests by allowing a user to use on marker for a more complex selection of markers.


## 03

### Objective: Sorting, filtering and randomizing tests

We will learn how to sort tests by test name, use a first and last markers to run the tests first->others->last.

We will learn how to filter tests according to custom criteria.

We will learn how to randomise our tests.


## 04

### Objective: We will filter our tests based on custom criteria

We can filter our tests in many ways. We will look how we can filter out certain tests based on a marker. This can be done with the -m flag but if we have a more complex set of markers we want and don't want, this can be done more easily with custom filtering.

We can make use of CLI flags that we used in the sort by testname project to group these custom filters into one flag.


## 05

### Objective: Dynamically create parametrized queries getting data from exteral sources

If we have frequet, common or large datasets for parametrization, using external sources rather than hard coding them makes more sense.

We will do this in this project.

## 06

### Objective: How to save global config values

This can be useful in more advanced cases.

## 07

### Objective: Store results from hooks

This can be useful in more advanced cases.

## 08

### Objective: Create stunning console reports

TWe now have the knowledge to add custom sections to the report and format the output to create stunning console ouput.

## 09

### Objective: Adding test results and duration times to our simple report

This is not any more complex than our basic report but there are some edge cases and knowledge that we only learnt in later projects, so I kept them till the end to avoid overload of information.
